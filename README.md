Soaking up the sun by the pool is one of life's simple pleasures. Whether you're taking a quick dip or spending the day lounging around, having the right poolside furniture can turn your backyard into a mini resort. And nothing defines that better than a comfortable and stylish swimming pool chair.

# What Are Swimming Pool Chairs Called?
<img width="720" height="720" alt="0_JggpGqsGmMKq40Ed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06b57b12-2135-4e81-8b2c-80200e89471b" />

Many people often wonder what pool chairs are officially called. Much like we refer to compact stools in the living room as **[dori chair](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/dori-stool)**, poolside chairs go by the names sunloungers or pool loungers. These chairs are typically elongated, allowing full-body rest, making them perfect for sunbathing, reading, or simply relaxing by the water.

# Types of Swimming Pool Chairs and Their Prices

While **[ottoman pouffe chair](https://threadvibeliving.com/collections/pouff-stool)** sometimes make an appearance poolside, they don't quite match the charm or function of proper swimming pool lounge chairs. The latter not only offer great support but also add an element of luxury to your space. For instance, pairing your lounger with a bold decor element like a **[jaguar statue](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/geometric-black-panther-showpiece-statue-length-41-cm)** on the nearby table can elevate the entire aesthetic.

## 1. Fixed Lounge Chairs

These are permanently placed by your pool and are designed for stability. With strong bases and a stylish build, they're ideal for those who don't plan on moving furniture around often. Typically made of wooden slats or **[round side table](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/mango-wood-round-shape-end-table-for-living-room-1)**, their price is on the higher side - especially if recliner features are added.

To complement this look, consider adding unique decor accents, like a quirky **[famous cat statues](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/cigar-cat)** placed on a side shelf nearby. It adds a playful twist to an otherwise relaxing zone.

## 2. Deck Chairs

If comfort and style are your top priorities, then deck chairs are the way to go. Designed with a natural slant that supports your back and legs, these **[black oval bench](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/oval-bench?variant=48047219179825)** are all about leisurely lounging. Prices vary based on materials - velvet or soft fabric raises the cost, while simpler foam options are more affordable.

You can enrich this space further by keeping a **[gorilla cigar ashtray](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/gorilla-party-ashtray-table-ascent)** on the side table - adding both functionality and a touch of character to your pool area.

## 3. Folding Lounge Chairs

If space is tight, folding lounge chairs are a smart pick. They're easy to move, store away neatly, and work great for small balconies or compact poolside setups. Most are made from lightweight materials like stainless steel or plastic, keeping them both affordable and practical. Add a **[sitting cat statue](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/sitting-cat-faceted-sculpture-height-27-cm)** nearby for a simple, charming touch that brings personality without taking up extra space.

Place them near statement elements like a **[girl face decoration](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/abstract-lady-face-hand-on-mouth-sculpture-office-home-decor-h-23-cm)** sculpture on your patio wall to give your poolside an artistic edge.

## 4. Wooden Deck Chairs

The classic and timeless option - wooden deck chairs never go out of style. Known for their durability and earthy appeal, these chairs are generally more expensive due to the quality of wood and craftsmanship involved.

To complete the look, you can place a **[brass marble bathroom set with tray](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/marble-bathroom-set-of-5?_pos=2&_sid=3ea622759&_ss=r)** (repurposed as a chic outdoor tray set) on a side table for holding towels, sunscreens, and refreshing drinks. It's an elegant way to mix functionality with design.

# Final Thoughts

Choosing the right swimming pool chair is just as important as selecting a **[bean chair](https://threadvibeliving.com/collections/bean-bag)** for your living room - it should be stylish, comfortable, and practical. Pair it with a thoughtful **[table design for home](https://threadvibeliving.com/collections/table)** to complete your poolside setup, and you've got the perfect spot to relax and unwind in style.
